It's caving in around me
What I thought was solid ground
I tried to look the other way
But I couldn't turn around
It's okay for you to hate me
For all the things I've done
I've made a few mistakes
But I'm not the only one

Was there ever any question
On how much I could take?
You kept feeding me your bullshit
Hoping I would break
Is there anybody out there?
Is there anyone who cares?
Is there anybody listening?
Will they hear my final prayers?
